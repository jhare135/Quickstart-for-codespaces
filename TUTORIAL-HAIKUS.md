# Haikus for Codespaces
This tutorial is a modification of [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart), which provides a tour of using codespaces with the [github/haikus-for-codespaces](https://github.com/github/haikus-for-codespaces) repo. This project uses JavaScript (Node.js), HTML templating (EJS), and CSS for styling to create a fun little webpage, but you don't have to actually know any of these programming languages in order to work with this tutorial and learn more about codespaces.

### Instructions
1. In the upper right-hand corner, click the green "Use this template" button and then select "Create new repository."
2. Make sure that the "Include all branches" slider is set to ON.

   Give your repository a name (quickstart-for-codespaces works) and a short description ("Clone of ECON-691/quickstart-for-codespaces for Tech Tacos" is an easy example). Leave visibility as "Public," and then click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom of the page. 
3. Please open [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) in a separate tab from this README set of instructions.
4. Read just the "Introduction" section; then come back to this instructions page. 
5. Click the green "<> Code" button and then click "Create codespace on main." Wait for the Codespace to load, which might take a few minutes! **You should now have 3 tabs open: A) these repo instructions, B) the GitHub document on getting started with codespaces, and C) the codespace itself.**
6. In Tab B (the GitHub document tutorial), scroll down to "Running the application." Follow the instructions to run the `npm run dev` command in the codespace (Tab C) and open the port in a new browser tab. **You should now have a 4th tap open: D) a webpage with haikus and pics of Octocat!**
7. Back in Tab B (GitHub tutorial), continue with "Edit the application" section. For the instruction "Edit the text field of the first haiku to personalize the application," simply **change the city** in the first poem from "seattle" to your favorite city.
8. Follow the "Committing and pushing your changes" section in Tab B. After you commit, you'll see a "Sync changes" option (not "publish new branch" since you're using an existing repo).
